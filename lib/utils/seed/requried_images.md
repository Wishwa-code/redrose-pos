Okay, I understand you want me to generate prompts that you can then use in an AI image generation tool (like Google's Imagen via Search Labs/Bard if available, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, etc.) to create images for each product listed in your SQL data.

I will extract the product information (mainly from title and description) and create a descriptive prompt for each row.

Important Notes:

Copy-Paste: You will need to copy each prompt below and paste it into an actual image generation tool. I cannot generate the images directly here.

Model Variation: The results will vary depending on the specific image generation model you use. You might need to slightly adjust the prompts (e.g., add style keywords like "photorealistic," "catalog style," "technical drawing," "illustration") for best results with your chosen tool.

Asbestos Warning: For products containing asbestos, the prompts aim for a neutral product depiction. Be mindful of generating images related to hazardous materials.

Clarity: I've tried to make the prompts clear based on the data. Generic items might yield generic images. Adding more detail (like specific colors, angles, or settings) to the prompts yourself can improve results.

Here are the image generation prompts based on your SQL data:
